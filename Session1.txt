
HTTP/1.1 : It works on the textual format. There is head of lineblocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnt get its all 
           resources. It uses requests resource inlining for use getting multiple pages.It compares data by itself.

HTTP 2: It works on the binary protocol. It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.It uses PUSH frame by 
        server that collects all multiple pages. It uses HPACK for data compression.


2. Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of 
   “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods.A property of an object can 
   be explained as a variable that is attached to the object. Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables.
   We can access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
                           
             eg., objectName.propertyName
    
   You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let’s create an object named myCar and give it properties named make,
   model, and year as follows:

               var myCar = new Object();
               myCar.make = 'Ford';
               myCar.model = 'Mustang';
               myCar.year = 1969;
